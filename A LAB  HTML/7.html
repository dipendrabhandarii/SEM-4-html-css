<h3>a. code</h3>
<p>Usually the content of the < code > element is presented in a monospaced font, just like
the code in most programming books (including this one). </p>
<p> <code> & lt;h1 & gt;This is a primary heading & lt;/h1 & gt; </code > </p >
<h3>b.kbd</h3>
<p>If, when talking about computers, you want to tell a reader to enter some text, you can use the < kbd >
element to indicate what should be typed in, as in this example below.The content of a < kbd > element is usually represented in a monospaced font, rather like the content of
the < code > element
</p>
<p> To force quit an application in Windows, hold down the <kbd> ctrl </kbd> ,
 <kbd> alt </kbd>and <kbd> delete </kbd>keys together. </p> 
<h3>c.var</h3>
<p> The < var > element is another of the elements added to help programmers. It is usually used in
conjunction with the < pre > and < code > elements to indicate that the content of that element is a
variable that can be supplied by a user. Typically, the content of a < var > element is italicized</p>
<p> <code> document.write(“ <var> user-name </var> ”) </code> </p> 
<h3>d.samp</h3>
<p> The < samp > element indicates sample output from a program, script, or the like. Again, it is mainly used
when documenting programming concepts.This tends to be displayed in a monospaced font.</p>
<p> The following line uses the & lt;samp & gt; element to indicate the output
from a script or program. </p>
 <p> <samp> This is the output from our test script. </samp> </p>
