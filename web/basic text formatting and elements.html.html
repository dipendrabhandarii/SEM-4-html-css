        <h2>Introducing HTML and XHTML</h2>
        <h2 align="center"> Tags and Elements</h2>
        <p>The two angled brackets and the character betweeen them are known as tags. </p>
        
        <p> Elements are the opening and the closing tags plus anything between those tags.</p> 
        <br>
        <b> Here note: XHTML tags should always be written in lowercase letters while html is not case sensative</b>
        <br>
        <p>You are going to spend most of the remaining part of this chapter ;earning the different elements you can use to describe the structure of text.</p>
        
            <ul type="square">
                <li><b> The six level heading :</b>  h1.h2.h3.h4.h5.h6</li>
                <li><b>Paragraphs</b>< p>, < pre>, line brakes < b r > and addresses< address></li>
                <li><b>Presentational elements:</b> < b>, < i>, < u>, < s>, < tt>, < sup> < sub> < strike> < big> < small> and < hr>
                   <li> <b>Pharase elements such as</b>  < em> < strong>< abbr>< acronym> < dfn> < blockquote> < q> < cite> < code> < kbd> < var>< samp>and < address>
                    <li> <b>Lists such as unordered list using </b> < ul> and < li>, ordered lists using < ol>and < li> and defining lists using < di>, < dt>,< dd>
                      </li>
            </ul>
        <div>we will discuss about list in next chapter to come</div>

        <h2 align="center">Basic text formatting</h2>
        <p> In this section, you will learn how to use what are known as <i>basic text formatting element</i></p><br>
        <list>
            <ul> 
                <li> < h1>,  < h2>,  < h3>,  < h4>,  < h5>,  < h6>, </h1></li>
                <li>< p >, < br > < prr ></li>
            </ul>
        </list>
        <h3 ><i>White spaces and flow</i> </h3> 
        <pre> < p> This paragraph shows how mulitple spaces    between   words are treated as single space. this is known as white     space collapsing < /p></pre>

        <h3> <i>Creating Headings usnig < hn> Elements</i> </h3>
            <p><h1>< h1>Heading 1< /h1>  </h1></p>
            <p><h2>< h2>Heading 2< /h2>  </h2></p> 
            <p><h3>< h1>Heading 3< /h3>  </h3></p> 
            <p><h4>< h4>Heading 4< /h4>  </h4></p> 
            <p><h5>< h1>Heading 5< /h5>  </h5></p> 
            <p><h6>< h6>Heading 6< /h6>  </h6></p> <br>

        <div>Most browsers display the contents of the < h1>< h2> < h3> elements larger
        than the default size of the text in the documents. The content of the  
         < h4 > elements would be the same size as the default text, and the content
        of the < h5> and < h6> elements would be smaller unless you instruct them otherwise using CSS> <br></
            div>
        <h3><i>The align Attribute (Deprecated) </i></h3>
        <p>The align attribute indicates whether the heading appears to the left, center, or right of the page (the default is the left). It can take the three
         values discussed in the table that follows.</p>

          <h1 align=”left”> Left-Aligned Heading </h1 >  < h1 align=”left” > Left-Aligned Heading < /h1 >
<!---- < p > This heading uses the align attribute with a value of left. < /p > --><p> This heading uses the align attribute with a value of left. </p>
 <h1 align="center"> Centered Heading </h1> < h1 align=”center” > Centered Heading < /h1 >  <br>
 <p> This heading uses the align attribute with a value of center. </p><br>
 <h1 align="right"> Right-Aligned Heading </h1> < h1 align=”right” > Right-Aligned Heading < /h1 > <br>
 < p > This heading uses the align attribute with a value of right. < /p > <br>

 <h3><i> Creating Paragraphs Using the < p >Element</i></h3>
 The < p > element offers another way to structure your text. Each paragraph of text should go in between
an opening < p > and closing < /p > tag, as in this example:<br>
 |<div>< p > Here is a paragraph of text. < /p ><div>
    <div> < p > Here is a second paragraph of text. < /p ></ p></div>
    <div>< p > Here is a third paragraph of text. < /p ></div>
<p> When a browser displays a paragraph, it usually inserts a new line before the next paragraph and adds a
little bit of extra vertical space, as given below:</p>
<p> Here is a paragraph of text. </p>
<p> Here is a second paragraph of text. </p>
<p> Here is a third paragraph of text. </p>
<br>
<h3> <i> Creating line breaks using the < br > Element</i></h3>
<p>Whenever you use the < br  > element, anything following it starts on the next line. The < br  >
    element is an example of an empty element ; you don ’ t need opening and closing tags, because there is
    nothing to go in between them. </p><br>
    You could use multiple < br  > elements to push text down several lines, and many designers use two
line breaks between paragraphs of text rather than using the < p > element to structure text, as follows:
<div>Paragraph one < br > < br  ></div>
<div>Paragraph two < br  > < br  ></div>
<div>Paragraph three < br  > < br > </div><br>
Paragraph one <br> <br>
Paragraph two <br> <br>
Paragraph three <br> <br>
<h3><i> Creating performatted text using the < pre >Elements</i></h3><br>
<p>Any text between the opening < pre > tag and the closing < /pre > tag will preserve the formatting of the
    source document.</p>
    <p> The most common uses of the < pre > element are to represent Java code. For example, the
        following shows some Java inside a < pre > element 
     <p>
        <div> < pre >
            <div> class java_demo</div>
            <div> {</div>
                   <div> public Static void main(String[] args)</div>
                    <div>{</div>
                    <div>int a;</div>
                    <div> a=10;</div>
                    <div>systen.out.println("The value of a is "+a);</div>
                <div>}</div>
             <div>}</div>
                
             < /pre> </div>
        </p>
        <p>you can below how the content of the < pre > element is display in the monospaced font. more important, you can see how it folows the formatting shows inside the< pre ><br>
        element-the white space is preserved.</p>
        <pre> 
            class java_demo
            {
               public Static void main(String[] args)
              {
                int a;
                a=10;
                systen.out.println("The value of a is "+a);
              }
            }
         </pre><br>
         <h2 align="center">Presentational Elements</h2><br>
         <p>These elements affect only the presentation of a document and the markup is of no
            other use. You can also achieve a similar appearance using CSS. However, they are still commonly used. 
            </p>
         <h3><i>The < b > Element</i></h3>
          <div> Anything that apppears in a< b > element is displayed in bold, like the word bold here</div>
        <div> <p>The following word is uses a <b>bold</b> typeface.</div><br>
            <h3><i>The < i > Element</i></h3>
            <div>The content of an < i> elementis displayed in italicized  text, like the word "italic "here.</i> </div>
            <div>The following word uses an <i>italic </i> typeface.</div>
            <br>
            <h3><i>The < u > Element (Deprecated)</i></h3>
               <div> The content of a < u > element is underlined with a simple line:</div>
              <div>The following word would be <u> underlined </u><br> 
            <h3><i>The < s > and < strike > Elements (Deprecated)</i></h3> 
            <div> The content of an < s > or < strike > element is displayed with a strikethrough, which is a thin line
                through the text ( < s > is just the abbreviated form of < strike > ).</div>
               <div> The following word would have a <s> strikethrough. </s> </div><br>
               <h3><i>The < tt >Element </i></h3>
               <div>The content of a < tt > element is written in monospaced font (like that of a teletype machine)</div>
               <div>The following word will appear in a <tt> monospaced </tt>font.
               </div>   <br>
               <p><big>Now let's take a look at the < sup > , < sub > , < big > , < small > , and < hr / > elements</big></p><br>
               <h3><i>The < sup >Element </i></h3>
               <div>The content of a < sup > element is written in superscript; it is displayed half a character ’ s height above
                the other characters and is also often slightly smaller than the text surrounding it. </div>
                <div>Written on the 31 <sup> st </sup>February</div><br>
                <h3><i>The < sub > Element<. </i></h3>
                <div>The content of a < sub > element is written in subscript; it is displayed half a character ’ s height beneath</sub>
                    the other characters and is also often slightly smaller than the text surrounding it.</div>
               <div>
                The EPR paradox <sub > 2 </sub > was devised by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.
                 </div><br>
                <h3><i>The < big >Element </i></h3>
                 <div>In early versions of HTML there were 7 standard sizes of text, and the < big > element was introduced to
                 make the contents of this element one font size larger than the rest of the text surrounding it (up to the
                 largest size — size 7). These days you should avoid using this element because it only has an effect on
                 the look of the document; it does not help describe the document ’ s structure or meaning. Instead you
                should use CSS to change the size of text.</div>
                <div> The following word should be <big> bigger </big>than those around it</div><br>
                <h3><i>The < small >Element 
                </i></h3>
                <div>The < small > element is the opposite of the < big > element, and its contents are displayed one font size
                    smaller than the rest of the text surrounding it. If the font is already the smallest, it has no effect. You can
                    nest several < small > elements inside one another, and the content of each gets one size smaller for
                    each element.</small></div>
                    <div> following word should be <small > smaller </small >than those around it.
                    </div><br>
                    <h3><i>The < hr  > Element </i></h3>
                    <div>The < hr / > element creates a horizontal rule across the page. It is an empty element, rather like the
                    < br / > element. </div>
                    <di><hr>
                    This is frequently used to separate distinct sections of a page where a new heading is not appropriate. </div><br>
                    <h2 align="center"> Phrase Element</h2>
                    <p> Some of the elements in this section are displayed in a manner similar to the Presentational Elements
                        < b > , < i > , < pre > , and < tt > that you have just read about, but the following elements are not just for
                       presentational purposes; they also describe something about their content. For example, the words
                       written in an < em > element will look just like the words in an < i > element, but the < em > element is
                       supposed to indicate the addition of emphasis.
                        This section covers the following elements:
                    
                            <ul type="square">
                                <li>  < em > and < strong > for emphasis</li>
                                <li>
                                    < blockquote > , < cite > , and < q > for quotations and citations</li>
                                   <li> < abbr > , < acronym > , and < dfn > for abbreviations, acronyms, and key terms</li>
                                  <li>< code > , < kbd > , < var > , and < samp > for computer code and information</li> 
                                  <li >< address > for addresses</li>
                            </ul>
                    
                       </p> <br>
                       <h3><i>The < em >Element Adds Emphasis </i></h3>
                       <div> The content of an < em > element is intended to be a point of emphasis in your document, and it is usually
                        displayed in italicized text. The kind of emphasis intended is on words such as “ must ” in the following
                        sentence: </div>
                        <div><p > You <em > must </em > remember to close elements in XHTML. </p > </div><br>
                        <h3><i>The < strong >Element Adds Strong Emphasis </i></h3>
                        <div> The < strong > element is intended to show strong emphasis for its content — stronger emphasis than
                            the < em > element. As with the < em > element, the < strong > element should be used only when you want
                            to add strong emphasis to part of a document. Most visual browsers display the strong emphasis in a
                            bold font. </div>
                            <p > < em > Always </ em > look at burning magnesium through protective colored glass as it < strong > can cause blindness < /strong > . </p >
                        <div><p > <em > Always </em > look at burning magnesium through protective colored glass as it <strong > can cause blindness </strong > . </p > </div>
        <br>
        <h3><i>The < address > Element Is for Addresses </i></h3>
        <div>Many documents need to contain a snail - mail address, and there is a special < address > element that is
            used to contain addresses. For example, here is the address for Wrox, inside an < address > element</div>
            < div>< address > Wrox Press, 10475 Crosspoint Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46256 < /address > < /div> 
        <div><address > Wrox Press, 10475 Crosspoint Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46256 </address > </div><br>
        <h3><i>The < abbr > Element Is for Abbreviations</i></h3>
            <div>You can indicate when you are using an abbreviated form by placing the abbreviation between opening
                < abbr > and closing < /abbr > tags.
                When possible, consider using a title attribute whose value is the full version of the abbreviations. For
               example, if you want to indicate that Bev is an abbreviation for Beverly, you can use the < abbr > element
               like so:</div>
            <div>I have a friend called < abbr title=”Beverly” > Bev < /abbr > .
            </div>
            <div>I have a friend called <abbr title=”Beverly” > Bev </abbr > .
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3><i>The < acronym > Element Is for Acronym Use </i></h3>
            <div>The < acronym > element allows you to indicate that the text between opening < acronym > and closing
                < /acronym > tags is an acronym.
                 When possible, use a title attribute on opening < acronym > tags whose value is the full version of the
                acronym. For example, if you want to indicate that XHTML was an acronym, you can use the < acronym >
                element.</div>
            <div>< p>This chapter covers marking up text in < acronym title=”Extensible Hypertext
                Markup Language” > XHTML < /acronym > < /p> </div>
            <div>This chapter covers marking up text in <acronym title=”Extensible Hypertext
                Markup Language” > XHTML </acronym>  </div><br>

                <h3><i>The < dfn > Element Is for Special Terms </i></h3>
                <p>The < dfn > element allows you to specify that you are introducing a special term. Its use is similar to the
                    italicized notes in this book used to introduce important new concepts. </p><br>

                   <div>< p>This book teaches you how mark up your documents for the Web using
                        < dfn > XHTML < /dfn > < /p><?div>

                <h3><i>The < blockquote > Element Is for Quoting Text </i></h3>
                <div>When you want to quote a passage from another source, you should use the < blockquote > element</div>
                <div>< p>  The following description of XHTML is taken from the W3C Web site:
                    < blockquote > XHTML 1.0 is the W3C’s first Recommendation for XHTML,
                   following on from earlier work on HTML 4.01, HTML 4.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML
                   2.0. < /blockquote > 
                   < /p></div>
                <p> The following description of XHTML is taken from the W3C Web site: </p>

                   2.0. </blockquote> <br>
                <h3><i>Using the cite Attribute with the < blockquote >Element </i></h3>
                <div>You can use the cite attribute on the < blockquote > element to indicate the source of the quote</div>
                <p>< blockquote cite=”http://www.w3.org/markup/” > XHTML 1.0 is the W3C’s first
                    Recommendation for XHTML, following on from earlier work on HTML 4.01, HTML
                    4.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0. < /blockquote > 
                    </p>
                    <div><blockquote cite=”http://www.w3.org/markup/” > XHTML 1.0 is the W3C’s first
                Recommendation for XHTML, following on from earlier work on HTML 4.01, HTML
                4.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0. </blockquote ></div><br>

                <h3><i>The < q > Element Is for Short Quotations</i></h3>
                <div>The < q > element is intended to be used when you want to add a quote within a sentence, rather than as
                    an indented block on its own</div>
                    <div>< p > As Dylan Thomas said, < q > Somebody’s boring me. I think it’s me < /q > . < /p > </div>
                    <p> As Dylan Thomas said, <q> Somebody’s boring me. I think it’s me </q > . </p> 
                <h3><i> The < cite > Element Is for Citations </i></h3>
                <div>If you are quoting a text, you can indicate the source by placing it between an opening < cite > tag and
                    closing < /cite > tag. As you would expect in a print publication, the content of the < cite > element is

                <h3><i>The < code > Element Is for Code</i></h3>
                <div>If your pages include any programming code (which is not uncommon on the Web), the following four
                    elements will be of particular use to you. Any code to appear on a web page should be placed inside a
                     < code > element. Usually the content of the < code > element is presented in a monospaced font, just like
                    the code in most programming books</div>
                    <div>< p > < code > & lt;h1 & gt;This is a primary heading & lt;/h1 & gt; < /code > < /p ></div>
                    <p > <code > & lt;h1 & gt;This is a primary heading & lt;/h1 & gt; </code>
         
            <h3> <i> The < kbd > Element Is for Text Typed on a Keyboard  </i></h3>
         <p>If, when talking about computers, you want to tell a reader to enter some text, you can use the < kbd >
            element to indicate what should be typed in, as in this example </p>
            <div>< p > To force quit an application in Windows, hold down the < kbd > ctrl < /kbd > ,
                < kbd > alt < /kbd >and < kbd > delete < /kbd >keys together. < /p > </div>
                <p > To force quit an application in Windows, hold down the <kbd > ctrl </kbd > ,
 <kbd > alt </kbd >and <kbd > delete </kbd >keys together. </p > 

    <h3><i>The < var > Element Is for Programming Variables</i></h3>
    <p>The < var > element is another of the elements added to help programmers. It is usually used in
        conjunction with the < pre > and < code > elements to indicate that the content of that element is a
        variable that can be supplied by a user</p>
    <div>< p > < code > document.write(“ < var > user-name < /var > ”) < /code > < /p > </div>
    <div><p > <code > document.write(“ <var > user-name </var > ”) </code > </p > </div>

    <h3><i>The < samp > Element Is for a Program Output</i></h3>
    <p>he < samp > Element Is for a Program Output
        The < samp > element indicates sample output from a program, script, or the like. Again, it is mainly used
       when documenting programming concepts</p>
    <div>< p > The following line uses the & lt;samp & gt; element to indicate the output
        from a script or program. < /p >
         < p > < samp > This is the output from our test script. < /samp > < /p > 
        </div>
        <p > The following line uses the & lt;samp & gt; element to indicate the output
from a script or program. <p >
 <p > <samp > This is the output from our test script. </samp > </p > <br>
