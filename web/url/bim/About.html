<img src="../../imagec.jpg" alt="image not found"><pre> Aesthetic photography is a photographic practice of capturing visual beauty within an image.

Aesthetic photos aim to utilize visual characteristics such as color, composition, lighting, and subject matter to create a visually pleasing photograph.</pre>
